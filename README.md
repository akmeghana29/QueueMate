What is QueueMate?

QueueMate is a smart virtual queue management system designed to simplify the way users wait in lines — whether it’s at a hospital, government office, or any service center. Users can pre-book their tokens, which indicate their number in the queue. They can keep checking live queue status while taking a break, recieve notifications when their turn is nearing and avoid unnecessary physical waiting, all from a single platform.

Why QueueMate?

Inspired by the long queues we all face daily, QueueMate was built to bring order, predictability, and peace to the chaos. Our mission is to make waiting smarter, not longer. With easy bookings, admin management, and real-time queue tracking, it's designed with both users and organizations in mind. As developers, upgrading our county's infrastructure and technology is our primary goal.

How it Works

Users sign up and select a location or service. Choose a time slot 3 hours prior and get live queue status. User will be notified when 5 more tokens are left Admins manage token numbers and control queues easily. All data is securely handled to ensure privacy.
